# 2nd LAB EXERCISE
Exercises on Dynamic Data Type Refinement (DDTR)

## Environment

This solution was specifically developed and tested in the following environment:

a. **Linux – GCC – Pthreads (e.g., GCC 4.8):**  
   Required for compiling and executing the provided code.

b. **Valgrind:**  
   A dynamic instrumentation profiling tool used for memory and threading analysis.  
   More information about installation can be found in the file [Exercise2.pdf](https://github.com/PanosMpel/Embedded-Systems-NTUA/blob/main/Lab2/Exercise2.pdf).
