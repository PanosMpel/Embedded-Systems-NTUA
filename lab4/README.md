# 4th Lab Exerscise : Exercise for High Level Synthesis on FPGA

## Environment

This solution was specifically developed and tested in the **Xilinx SDSoC 2016.4** environment.  
The following environments are required for the exercises:

- **Exercise 1:** Xilinx SDSoC 2016.4.
- **Exercise 2:** Jupyter Notebook or **Google Colab**.

The code should be used and tested in the same version for the best results.

## Repository Contents

1. **Original Code (`SDSoC_src_Ex1_Original`):**  
   The initial version of the code before applying the necessary changes. The original code is used for **Exercise 1: Performance and Resource Measurement**.

2. **Modified Code (`SDSoC_src_Ex1_Modified`):**  
   The updated version of the code with the required fixes applied to solve the issue. This version is also used for **Exercise 1: Performance and Resource Measurement**.

3. **`.ipynb_checkpoints` Folder:**  
   The provided code for **Exercise 2: Quality Measurement**, which includes Jupyter Notebook checkpoints.
