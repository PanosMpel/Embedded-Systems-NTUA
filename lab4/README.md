# 4th Lab Exerscise : Exercise for High Level Synthesis on FPGA

## Environment

This solution was specifically developed and tested in the **Xilinx SDSoC 2016.4** environment.  
The following environments are required for the exercises:

- **Exercise 1:** Xilinx SDSoC 2016.4.
- **Exercise 2:** Jupyter Notebook or **Google Colab**.

The code should be used and tested in the same version for the best results.

## Repository Contents

1. **Original Code :**  
   The initial version of the code before applying the necessary changes. The original code is used for **Exercise 1: Performance and Resource Measurement**.

2. **Modified Code :**  
   This version includes the necessary improvements and optimizations . This updated version is also used for **Exercise 1: Performance and Resource Measurement**.

3. **Data:**  
   A zipped folder containing the dataset used for training and testing the implemented algorithms.

4. **Outputs:**  
   Contains the output files generated from different runs of the exercises.

5. **[Lab4.pdf](https://github.com/PanosMpel/Embedded-Systems-NTUA/blob/main/lab4/Lab4.pdf):**  
   A detailed document with step-by-step instructions for completing the exercises.

6. **`ipynb checkpoints` Folder:**  
   Includes Jupyter Notebook checkpoints for **Exercise 2: Quality Measurement**.
